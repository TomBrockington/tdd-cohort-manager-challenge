- CohortManager
  - Properties
    - cohorts: [] of Cohort
  - Methods
    - addStudent( cohortName, studentDetails )
      - adds studentDetails to Cohort with `cohortName` if Cohort exists and student has not already been added
        - returns true if successful

- StudentDetails ?? We could consider making this a class rather than just using a JS Object
